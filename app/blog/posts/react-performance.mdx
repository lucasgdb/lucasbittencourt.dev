### Reconciliation algorithm

In React, a single component can have nested components. When it is rendered, all its children are rendered together.

There is a underlying diffing algorithm called the [reconciliation algorithm](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html)
that manages the render of the component hierarchy.

To understand what the render process does, we can break it down into 3 parts:

1. It generates the [Virtual DOM](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html#what-is-the-virtual-dom) from JSX code
2. It compares the Virtual DOM with the real DOM using a diffing algorithm
3. It commits only the differences to the real DOM

Without the reconciliation algorithm, updating the real DOM with every component rendering would be an extremely slow process.

### Memoization

It's a technique which saves the return value from pure functions.
Allowing them to be memoized and thus avoiding heavy recalculations.
Pure functions are functions that don't depend on external values;
therefore, it will always return the same result given the same input.

### Referential equality

When we say referential equality, it means that we need to ensure reference types are equal when they have not changed.

In JavaScript we have primitive types and reference types.

- Two idential primitive types are always equal in a shallow compararison (e.g. `25 === 25`, `'Lucas' === 'Lucas'`, `true === true`).
- Two idential reference types are not always equal in a shallow comparison (e.g. `{ age: 25 } === { age: 25 }`, `['Lucas'] === ['Lucas']`).
  Therefore, in every render, they appear different from the previous render.

We enforce these reference types (e.g. objects, arrays and functions) to be the same as the previous render to use in these scenarios:

- The dependencies array of useEffect
- Component props

## React Hook: useMemo

Syntax:

```ts
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => expensiveFunction(), dependencies);
```

You use `useMemo` to memoize values, helping avoid heavy recalculations or to maintain referential equality.

### 1. Avoiding heavy recalculations

#### Don't do this:

```ts
// this will trigger on every render
const filteredList = heavyFunction(myList);
```

#### Do this instead:

```ts
// this triggers only when myList changes
const filteredList = useMemo(() => heavyFunction(myList), [myList]);
```

### 2. Maintaining referential equality

#### Don't do this:

```tsx
const person = { name: props.name, age: props.age };

// This will trigger on every render
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(person);
}, [person]);
```

#### Do this instead:

```tsx
const person = useMemo(
  () => ({ name: props.name, age: props.age }),
  [props.name, props.age]
);

// this triggers only when person changes
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(person);
}, [person]);
```

## React Hook: useCallback

Syntax:

```ts
const memoizedFunction = useCallback(functionToMemoize, dependencies);
```

You use `useCallback` to memoize functions, allowing you to maintain referential equality.

### Maintaining referential equality

#### Don't do this:

```tsx
const doSideEffect = () => setTimeout(console.log, 1000);

// this will trigger on every render
useEffect(() => {
  cosnt sideEffect = doSideEffect();

  return () => clearTimeout(sideEffect);
}, [doSideEffect]);
```

#### Do this instead:

```tsx
const doSideEffect = useCallback(() => setTimeout(console.log, 1000), []);

// this triggers only once
useEffect(() => {
  const sideEffect = doSideEffect();

  return () => clearTimeout(sideEffect);
}, [doSideEffect]);
```

#### Do this instead:

```tsx
const doSideEffect = useCallback(
  () => setTimeout(() => console.log(name), 1000),
  [name]
);

// this triggers only when name changes
useEffect(() => {
  const sideEffect = doSideEffect();

  return () => clearTimeout(sideEffect);
}, [doSideEffect]);
```

## React: memo

Syntax:

```ts
const MemoizedComponent = memo(ComponentToMemoize, diffingAlgorithm?);
```

As we know, when a component renders, all its children are rendered by default.
However, to skip rendering a component whose props have not changed, we can memoize it with `memo` function.
The default diffing algorithm uses a shallow comparison (===).

#### shallow comparison

```tsx
function ComponentToMemoize(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{props.name}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

function diffingAlgorithm(prevProps, nextProps) {
  return previousProps.name === nextProps.name;
}

const MemoizedComponent = memo(ComponentToMemoize, diffingAlgorithm);
```

## Why should we use the key property in loops?

Syntax:

```tsx
{
  list.map((item) => <p key={item.id}>{item.text}</p>);
}
```

The key attribute helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed,
which is essential for performance optimization, especially during the re-render process.
Typically, the key should be a unique identifier such as an ID from your data.

### Why should not we use the index in loops?

Syntax:

```tsx
{
  list.map((item, index) => <p key={index}>{item.text}</p>);
}
```

In a scenario where there is a list with 10 items and there is a change of position, addition or removal,
all the element keys will change in order (0..10), this can lead to unnecessary re-renders and decreased performance.

## Avoiding derived states

Derived states are states created by another state.

#### Don't do it!

```tsx
const [repos, setRepos] = useState([]);
const [filteredRepos, setFilteredRepos] = useState([]);
const [search, setSearch] = useState([]);

useEffect(() => {
  if (search.length) {
    setFilteredRepos(repos.filter((repo) => repo.name.includes(search)));
  }
}, [search, repos]);
```

#### Do it!

```tsx
const [repos, setRepos] = useState([]);
const [search, setSearch] = useState([]);

const filteredRepos = repos.filter((repo) => repo.name.includes(search));
```

We don't need an additional state derived from another state. We can just create a new variable at runtime.
